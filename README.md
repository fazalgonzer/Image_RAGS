# Image Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This project implements an **Image Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that allows users to query images using image embeddings for efficient and accurate retrieval. The system leverages a combination of **image feature extraction** and **RAG retrieval** to provide relevant results based on user queries.

## Features

- **Image Embedding-Based Retrieval**: Query images using image embeddings for fast, contextually relevant results.
- **RAG Architecture**: Integrates image retrieval with generative models for better content understanding and response generation.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Optimized for both speed and accuracy in image-based queries.
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Image-RAG-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Image-RAG-System
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Query the system**:
   Upload an image or use a query to search for relevant images using the Image RAG model.
